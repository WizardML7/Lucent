# Lucent
COMPLETE
V1 of Results Listview
V1 of Results Graph view
Option to switch views in settings
Make the results only show up after a scan is started. 
Added animations!

TODO

ADVANCED animations, I envision the yellow circle elements duplicated outside of the logo that will appear and spin around the circle while the scan is active

Implementing dark mode. 

NEEDS A NEW BRANCH
Making it so that different scan options show different devices and so on. The reason this needs a new branch is because of how many widgets this will change. 

Rethink/reorganize settings, scan, and results buttons. ?? I like it at this point we will have to talk it out
